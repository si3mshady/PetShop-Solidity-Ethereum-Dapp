This might change but the most recent solidity global variables you can find them here @SolidityDocumentation

block.blockhash(uint blockNumber) returns (bytes32): hash of the given block - only works for 256 most recent, excluding current, blocks - deprecated in version 0.4.22 and replaced by blockhash(uint blockNumber).

block.coinbase (address): current block miner’s address

block.difficulty (uint): current block difficulty

block.gaslimit (uint): current block gaslimit

block.number (uint): current block number

block.timestamp (uint): current block timestamp as seconds since unix epoch

gasleft() returns (uint256): remaining gas

msg.data (bytes): complete calldata

msg.gas (uint): remaining gas - deprecated in version 0.4.21 and to be replaced by gasleft()

msg.sender (address): sender of the message (current call)

msg.sig (bytes4): first four bytes of the calldata (i.e. function identifier)

msg.value (uint): number of wei sent with the message

now (uint): current block timestamp (alias for block.timestamp)

tx.gasprice (uint): gas price of the transaction

tx.origin (address): sender of the transaction (full call chain)

addmod(uint x, uint y, uint k) returns (uint): compute (x + y) % k where the addition is performed with arbitrary precision and does not wrap around at 2**256. Assert that k != 0 starting from version 0.5.0.

mulmod(uint x, uint y, uint k) returns (uint): compute (x * y) % k where the multiplication is performed with arbitrary precision and does not wrap around at 2**256. Assert that k != 0 starting from version 0.5.0.

keccak256(...) returns (bytes32): compute the Ethereum-SHA-3 (Keccak-256) hash of the (tightly packed) arguments

sha256(...) returns (bytes32): compute the SHA-256 hash of the (tightly packed) arguments

sha3(...) returns (bytes32): alias to keccak256

ripemd160(...) returns (bytes20): compute RIPEMD-160 hash of the (tightly packed) arguments

ecrecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) returns (address): recover the address associated with the public key from elliptic curve signature or return zero on error (example usage)

this (current contract’s type): the current contract, explicitly convertible to Address

selfdestruct(address recipient): destroy the current contract, sending its funds to the given Address

suicide(address recipient): deprecated alias to selfdestruct
